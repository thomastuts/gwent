# Abilities
There are two kinds of abilities: unit abilities and special abilities.

## Unit abilities
These are abilities that are printed on a card below the unit's type.

### Medic
Choose one card from your discard pile and play it instantly (no heroes or special cards).

### Tight bond
Place next to a card with the same name to double the strength of both cards.

### Morale boost
Adds 1 strength to all units in the row (except itself).

### Spy
Place on your opponent’s battlefield (counts towards opponent’s total), and draw 2 cards from your deck

### Muster
Immediately play cards with the same name.

### Agile
Card can be placed into Melee or Ranged row.

### Scorch
Destroy opponent’s Melee units if his Melee strength is over 10.

## Special abilities
These are abilities that are triggered by a non-unit card, or a leader ability.

### Weather cards
#### Biting Frost
Sets the strength of all melee units to 1 for both players

#### Impenetrable Fog
Sets the strength of all ranged units to 1 for both players

#### Torrential Rain

#### Clear Weather
Eliminates all weather effects from the board.

### Other ability cards
#### Decoy
Swap with a card on the battlefield to return it to your hand.

#### Scorch
Destroy the card with the highest damage (or all cards for the same tied highest damage) on the board. 

#### Commander's horn

### Leader abilities
Instead of card abilities, these are abilities that can be used **once** during an entire match. Each leader has their
own unique ability that influences the battle in some way.
